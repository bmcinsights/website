          Hey there, SEE graduate! I'm Manish, a second-year A-Level student at
          British Model College, and I know exactly what's going through your
          mind right now. Two years ago, I was in your shoes, puzzling over the
          big question: "+2 or A-Levels?" After experiencing A-Levels at BMC
          firsthand, I want to share everything I wish I'd known back then.

        <p className="text-gray-300 text-xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
          <span className="font-semibold">What Actually ARE A-Levels?</span>
          <br /> Let's cut through the confusion. A-Levels (or Cambridge
          International A-Levels, if we're being fancy) is basically the British
          equivalent of +2, but with some major perks. Here's what makes it
          different:

        <p className="text-gray-300 text-xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Remember all those subjects you had to study in SEE whether you liked
          them or not? A-Levels lets you pick just 3-4 subjects you're actually
          interested in. At BMC, we've got plenty to choose from:
          <br />
          - Science stream: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics
          <br />
          - Business stream: Business, Economics, Accounting, Mathematics
          <br />
          - Technology stream: Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics
          <br />
          - Mixed combinations are totally possible too!(yes, really!)

          <span className="font-medium">The Academic Scene</span>
          <br />
          - Classes usually run from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (with 2-3 breaks in
          between)
          <br />
          - Small classes (my largest class has 25 students)
          <br />
          - Lots of practical work and experiments in our labs
          <br />
          - Teachers who feel more like mentors - they're always up for a chat
          after class
          <br />
          - Regular assessments (trust me, they help you improve!)
        </p>

          College life at BMC is where it gets exciting:
          <br />
          - I'm part of The BMC Insights team (co-founded it) - we run our own web
          platform where we publish research, blogs, events at BMC
          <br />
          - Tons of clubs: Debate, MUN, Sports, Music, etc.
          <br />
          - Student engaging events like Science Fair, Workshops, Inter-School
          Competitions
          <br />
          - Sports competitions (our football team is pretty decent!)
        </p>

          Not gonna lie - the first few months were a bit challenging. But BMC
          has your back:
          <br />
          - We have a two-week orientation program that really helps
          <br />
          - Senior buddies who guide you through everything
          <br />
          - Study skills workshops that teach you how to handle A-Level
          coursework
          <br />
          - Super helpful teachers who understand you're adjusting
        </p>

          <br />
          What makes BMC different? Here's what I've experienced:
          <br />
          - Amazing labs (our physics lab is my favorite spot)
          <br />
          - Library with great study spaces and resources
          <br />
          - Regular guest speakers from different fields
          <br />
          - University counseling that actually works

          <span className="font-semibold">The Real Investment</span>
          <br />
          Let's talk money (because it matters):
          <br />
          - Fees are higher than +2, but there are scholarships that can cover
          up-to 100% of tuition for high achieving students
          <br />
          - Merit scholarships can cover up to 100% of tuition
          <br />
          - All facilities included in fees (no hidden charges)
          <br />
          - Extra classes and support at no additional cost
        </p>

          <span className="font-semibold">Why I Chose BMC (And Why You Might Too)</span>
          <br />
          What sold me on BMC was:
          <br />
          - The freedom to study what I actually enjoy
          <br />
          - Opportunities like The BMC Insights to develop real skills
          <br />
          - Amazing friends from diverse backgrounds
          <br />
          - Teachers who know their stuff and actually care
          <br />
          - A study environment that pushes you to think, not just memorize
